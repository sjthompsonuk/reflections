What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

-It creates a git metadata file. This allows git commands and tracking to occur within the folder set as the repository holder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

-The staging area is the group of files intended that exist in the working directory for the next commit. The repository is all the commits made so far.
