When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-For collaborative work
-If using multiple machines
-To allow live viewing/access to the code for feedback purposes

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-If work has been separated out into work-streams/branches in a collaborative way
-If many people are working on the same branch you may wish to discuss/decide about consciously merging files
